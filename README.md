# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

# World Bank Population Dataset

# Objective

The objective of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the World Bank population dataset and visualize population distribution using appropriate charts.

# Dataset Description

The project uses three datasets from the World Bank:

1. Population Data
   Contains year-wise population data (1960–2023) for countries and aggregate regions.

2. Country Metadata
   Provides country-level information such as region and income group.
   Used to distinguish real countries from aggregate regions.

3. Indicator Metadata
   Contains metadata related to the population indicator.

# Tools & Libraries Used

1. Python

2. Pandas – data manipulation and analysis

3. Matplotlib – data visualization

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# The following steps were performed:

1. Loaded datasets and removed unnecessary columns

2. Inspected dataset structure using:

    head()

    shape

    columns

    info()

    describe()

3. Analyzed missing values

4. Identified year-wise population columns (1960–2023)

# Visualizations
1. World Population Growth (1960–2023)

2. A line chart showing global population growth over time.

3. Helps understand long-term population trends.

4. Top 10 Most Populated Countries (2023)

5. A bar chart visualizing population distribution across the top 10 countries.

6. Aggregate regions such as World and income groups were removed using metadata to ensure
   accurate country-level comparison.

# Key Insight
  The most populated country in 2023 is India with population 1,417,173,173

# Key Highlights

Proper handling of missing values

Use of metadata to filter aggregate regions

Clear and interpretable visualizations

Clean, well-structured Python code


# Conclusion

This task demonstrates a clear understanding of data exploration techniques and effective visualization methods for real-world datasets. The analysis provides meaningful insights into global and country-wise population trends.
